# 🦜 TotaUI v2 - An Improved Ollama WebUI

Welcome to **TotaUI v2**, the next version of my React-based web interface for running local Large Language Models (LLMs) like Ollama. This updated version improves on the original TotaUI, making it easier and faster to chat with your local models.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Here’s how to get it up and running on your machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhaneshdutta/totaUI-v2.git
cd totaUI-v2
```

### 2. Install the dependencies

You’ll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Once you have that, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the app

To launch the web interface locally:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You’re ready to interact with your local LLM!
